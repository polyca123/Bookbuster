# Bookbuster

This app is powered by Bulma CSS, HTML, CSS, Javascript - and utilzes the Google Books API and the OMDB Movie API.

Have you ever wanted to know if your favorite movie is bassed off of a book? Or vice versa?

This application allows the user to search for a movie/book and will be presented with relevant books and movies pulled from the APIs.

Each movie and book will show some descriptive information such as title, release date and other information.

The user can view movies and books side by side, and can save their favorites. 

The user can view their saved books and movies on the saved items tab (saved through local storage and will show on the page), as well as delete the saved items.

The user can also view additional movie and book details on the item from the saved items tab.
